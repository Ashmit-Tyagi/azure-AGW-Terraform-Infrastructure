# Azure-AGW-Terraform-Infrastructure


## This project uses Terraform to provision and manage a secure, web application on Azure. The application is a simple NGINX server running within a Docker container. All infrastructure is defined as code, enabling repeatable and consistent deployments.

## Prerequisites

    - Terraform CLI: Download and install the latest version.

    - Azure CLI: Download and install the Azure command-line tool.

    - Git: To clone the repository.
    
### Also be authenticated to your Azure account. Open your terminal and run az login to perform an interactive login and set your default subscription.


## Repository Structure

### The project uses a standard and scalable repository structure to support different environments (dev, prod) and reusable infrastructure modules.

### The Terraform configuration in this project serves as a blueprint for an entire web application stack. It automatically provisions the following key components in Azure:

    - Resource Group: A logical container to hold all the infrastructure resources.

    -  Virtual Network: A private network to host the application.

    - Two Subnets: A public subnet for the Application Gateway and a private subnet for the Virtual Machines.

    - Network Security Group (NSG): A virtual firewall to secure traffic to the VMs.

    - Two Virtual Machines: Ubuntu servers that will host the web applications.

    - Application Gateway: An application load balancer with a public IP that routes traffic based on URL paths.

    - Backend Pools: Two distinct pools, each containing the private IP of one of the VMs

## CI/CD Automation with Jenkins

### This project includes a Jenkinsfile for automated, multi-environment deployments. The pipeline is designed to be fully automated and follows secure practices.

#### 1. Parameters: The Jenkins job accepts env as a parameter to deploy to dev or prod. The admin_password is provided as a secure input at runtime.

#### 2. Secure Authentication: The pipeline uses an Azure Service Principal for non-interactive login. The Jenkinsfile uses the withCredentials block to securely inject the clientId, clientSecret, and tenantId into the build environment.

#### 3. Execution Flow: The pipeline executes the init, plan, and apply commands in sequence, ensuring a consistent and reliable deployment every time.

#### 4. Multi-Environment Support: The Jenkinsfile dynamically navigates to the correct environments/<env> directory based on the user's input, allowing the same pipeline to deploy to different environments.
